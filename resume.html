 If I am a student engineer in computer engineering today, know that it was not always the case, my studies predestined me in the world of civil engineering, this one did not bring me a professional development. So I decided to retrain in the IT world. What I can tell you is that it is a wise choice.<br>

I wonder what’s next ...</I></p>  </marquee>
